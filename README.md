# river - Streaming Remote Procedure Calls

It's like tRPC but...

- with JSON Schema Support
- with full-duplex streaming
- with support for service multiplexing
- with Result types and error handling
- over WebSockets

## Developing

- `npm i` -- install dependencies
- `npm run check` -- lint
- `npm run format` -- format
- `npm run test` -- run tests
- `npm publish` -- cut a new release (should bump version in package.json first)
